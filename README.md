# small microServices app for create posts and- omments with react and express

My first time building a mirco service applicaion ,So I just fouced in the communcation betweent servcies and the deployment. <br>
I used asynchronous communcation between services. <br>
and the event-bus service is responsible for sending evens to all other services works as event streaming (just sending events and saves them in memory) <br>
used **docker** for containerization and **kubernetes** for containers orchestration.
