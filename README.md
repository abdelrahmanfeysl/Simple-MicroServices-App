# simple microServices app  with Express and React

My first time building a mirco service applicaion ,This app for create posts and comments<br>
I used asynchronous communcation between services. <br>
and the event-bus service is responsible for sending evens to all other services works as event streaming (just sending events and saves them in memory) <br>
used **docker** for containerization and **kubernetes** for containers orchestration.
